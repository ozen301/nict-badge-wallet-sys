# NICT Badge & Wallet System

This repository implements the **Badge & Wallet System** for the NICT project carried out by Tohoku University. It manages NFT-based badges, bingo cards, and blockchain transactions.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.11

### 1. Install the library (in editable mode)
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure .env file
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify as needed.

### 3. Initialize the database
```bash
python scripts/init_db.py
python scripts/seed_dev.py  # optional, seed dev data
```

This by default creates `dev.db` (SQLite) with all schema objects. The `init_db.py` script will print all created tables:

```
Created tables: admins, audit_logs, bingo_cards, bingo_cells, blockchain_transactions, nft_conditions, nft_templates, nfts, user_nft_ownership, users
```
---

## Switch Databases
Simply change the `DB_URL` variable in `.env`:

```python
DB_URL="sqlite:///./dev.db"  # SQLite by default
```

Any URL supported by SQLAlchemy is valid here.

---

## Code Examples

See the Jupyter notebook [`code_examples.ipynb`](code_examples.ipynb) for code snippets:

- Setting up the engine and models
- Basic CRUD with SQLAlchemy 2.0
- Using `ChainClient` to get balance/NFTs and mint an NFT

Before running the notebook, ensure your `.env` is configured (copy from `.env.example`).

## Run Tests (for Development)
The repository includes unit tests (generated by Codex) under `tests/` using Python's built-in `unittest`.

Run all tests:
```bash
cd tests
python -m unittest -v
```

Run specific tests/files:
```bash
cd tests
python -m unittest -v test_db_utils test_models
```

---

## TODO
* Add workflow examples of typical scenarios including user registration and user's NFT acquisition & bingo card update.
* Implement `NFTCondition`'s `location_range` and `other_conditions` verification logic.
* Include NFT metadata in blockchain related operations. (Currently not implemented due to API bugs.)
* Update `sync_nfts_from_chain` method in `user.py` to handle NFTs that are on chain but not in DB (Need NFT metadata to be embedded in the NFTs on chain).
* Improve error handling for request-related functions.
* Add Alembic.
* Implement audit logging.
