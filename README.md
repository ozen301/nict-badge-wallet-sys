# NICT Badge & Wallet System

This repository implements the **Badge & Wallet System** for the NICT project carried out by Tohoku University. It manages NFT-based badges, bingo cards, and blockchain transactions.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.11

### 1. Install the library (in editable mode)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ozen301/nict-badge-wallet-sys.git
cd nict-badge-wallet-sys
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure .env file
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify as needed.

### 3. Initialize the database
```bash
python scripts/init_db.py
python scripts/seed_dev.py  # optional, seed dev data
```

This by default creates `dev.db` (SQLite) with all schema objects. The `init_db.py` script will print all created tables:

```
Created tables: admins, audit_logs, bingo_cards, bingo_cells, blockchain_transactions, nft_conditions, nft_templates, nfts, user_nft_ownership, users
```
---

## Switch Databases
Simply change the `DB_URL` variable in `.env`:

```python
DB_URL="sqlite:///./dev.db"  # SQLite by default
```

Any URL supported by SQLAlchemy is valid here.

## Documentation and Examples
See [docs/workflows.md](./docs/workflows.md) for common workflows. The workflows encapsulate typical sequences of operations using the models defined in this project.

Check the Jupyter notebook [docs/code_examples.ipynb](./docs/code_examples.ipynb) for practical usage of these workflows. The notebook provides runnable examples including:
- Setting up the database engine and models
- Basic CRUD with SQLAlchemy 2.0
- Using the models defined in this project to create users, NFTs, etc.
- Common workflows such as user registration, NFT issuance, and NFT Synchronization from the blockchain.

---

## Run Tests (for Development)
The repository includes unit tests (generated by Codex) under `tests/` using Python's built-in `unittest`.

Run all tests:
```bash
cd tests
python -m unittest -v
```

Run specific tests/files:
```bash
cd tests
python -m unittest -v test_db_utils test_models
```

---

## TODO
* Implement `NFTCondition`'s `location_range` and `other_conditions` verification logic.
* Improve error handling for request-related functions.
* Add Alembic.
* Implement audit logging.
