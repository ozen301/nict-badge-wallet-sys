        Notes
        -----
        This evaluation process performs the following steps:

        1. Resolve the most recent :class:`UserNFTOwnership`
           record to capture which user owned the NFT at evaluation time.
        2. Derive the deterministic draw number from the NFT origin.
        3. Run the scoring algorithm (when a winning number is provided) and
           save the result (in "win", "lose", or "pending" string format)
           expected by the database model.
        4. Upsert the :class:`PrizeDrawResult` row.
